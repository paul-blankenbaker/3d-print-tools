# Feather Breadboard Mount

This is a simple mount for a half size breadboard along with an Adafruit
Feather board. The design goals for this project were as follows:

* To support a wide variety of Adafruit Feather form factors (I've learned
that the mounting holes are not always the same as well as components that
are attached to the ends of the board).
* To be usable with Feathers that have stacking headers (hence the
elevation).
* To provide labels that can be glued onto the headers.
* To fit inside an empty 16 oz peanut butter jar. My wife is a huge fan
of Natural Crunchy and is constantly supplying me with these awesome
containers. This lets you store your work safely keeping it relatively
protected from kids, cats and other chaos.

# Requirements

* A development board having the Adafruit Feather form factor.
* Half length breadboard (http://adafru.it/64 or compatible).
* Headers soldered to your feather (http://adafru.it/2886 or compatible).
Thru headers should work, but have not been tested.
* One or two 10 mm to 14 mm M2.5 bolts and nuts to lock down board (12 mm to 16 mm if using spacer).
* Optional print out of header labels and the necessary scissors and glue.
to attach them to the headers. Make sure that you print at 100% (no scaling).
* Optional jar of peanut butter.

# Assembly

* Solder headers to your Feather board
* Optionally print out labels, cut out and glue onto headers
* Attach board to 3D printed mounting plate
* Stick breadboard onto 3D printed mounting plate
* Consume peanut butter, clean container and use as protective case for
project when working on something else

# Notes

* The SVG file contains the source for the labels created using InkScape (free vector graphics tool). Use this file to create your own labels or if you have problems getting the PDF file to print at 100% scale.
* The two holes in the bottom of the board are for possible future use. I'm thinking about whether an outer enclosure might be nice and might use these holes for alignment or fasteners.
